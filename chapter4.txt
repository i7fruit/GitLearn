Chapter 4

For remote repositories

Create a new repository on Git hub, give it a name, and/or a description and a Readme.md

Copy the http/ssh link address shown

If you have a local repository you wanna push, then use the "git remote add origin <url copied from github>" command.

REMOTE tells your local git repository that you've created a remote repository on the internet and want to transfer your commits there.

ORIGIN is the name of the remote. It can be called anything, but just called Origin by convention

After creating the remote, push the local repo to the remote repo with the push command

"git push -u origin master"
-u links the local to the remote
Local repo's pushed to the remote name origin, and the branch called master

The MASTER branch is the default/main branch of all the commits

ADDING A BRANCH
Use the "git branch <branch_name>" command to create a new branch

Check braches available by using the "git branch" command

Use the "git checkout <branch_name> to switch to the branch you want to switch to
