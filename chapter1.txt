The Story directory is the WORKING DIRECTORY


To initialize a git local repository, type "git init"
this initializes an empty git repository inside the Story directory.


In order to start tracking the changes of my files, e.g this file containing this text, I need to add this file to a STAGING AREA.


STAGING AREA: An intermediate place where one can pick and choose what files in the Working Directory that one wants to commit. 


Use the "git status" command to see what's in the staging area.
UNTRACKED FILES, which show in red text, show files that are in the working directory, but have not been added to the staging area.


To add to the staging area and start tracking changes in the file, use the "git add <file_name>" command. Files in the staging area will be shown in green text, and are ready to be committed. "git add <file_name> adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.


Use "git commit" to commit a file.
Use the -m flag to add a commit message. A commit message helps one keep track of what changes one has made in each commit. Eg git commit -m "Initial Commit" shows that this is a starting point. Write commit messages in the present tense. "git commit" commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.

The "git log" command keeps a log of commits made.
